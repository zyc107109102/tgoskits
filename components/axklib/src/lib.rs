//! axklib — small kernel-helper abstractions used across the microkernel
//!
//! This crate exposes a tiny, no_std-compatible trait (`Klib`) that the
//! platform/board layer must implement. The trait provides a handful of
//! common kernel helpers such as memory mapping helpers, timing utilities,
//! and IRQ registration. The implementation is supplied by the platform
//! (see `modules/axklib-impl`) and consumed by drivers and other modules.
//!
//! The crate also provides small convenience modules (`mem`, `time`, `irq`)
//! that re-export the trait methods with shorter names to make call sites
//! more ergonomic.
//!
//! Example usage:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! // map 4K of device MMIO at physical address `paddr`
//! let vaddr = axklib::mem::iomap(paddr, 0x1000)?;
//!
//! // busy-wait for 100 microseconds
//! axklib::time::busy_wait(core::time::Duration::from_micros(100));
//!
//! // request a shared IRQ action
//! let irq = axklib::irq::try_legacy_irq(32)?;
//! let handle = axklib::irq::request_shared(irq, my_irq_handler)?;
//! ```
